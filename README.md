## Compatibility
Gmail notifier is fully tested on **Windows 7** desktop *(SP1)* and on a **Windows 10** laptop.

Many other Windows operating systems may work, like Windows 8/8.1/Server, but are not extensively tested for the moment. Regarding the .NET Framework version, some operating systems like Windows Vista/XP are no longer supported.


## Dependencies
To ensure a stable running of Gmail notifier, you need to have **some requirements** setted on your machine.

1. Microsoft `.NET Framework 4.7.2` minimum required

Note that this version of the .NET Framework **evolve in time**: the application cares about **system security** and having one of the latest .NET version is very important for the final user. By default, if you don't have the required version installed, the application will display a message and propose to download the specified version on the **Microsoft official site**.


## Download
#### Setup installer
The setup installer contains both `32 bits (x86)` and `64 bits (x64)` versions. Its the better way to install Windows application and allows you to **cleanly install/uninstall** the application with ease. Note that you will need **administrators rights** to properly complete the installation. Recommended for all users.

* :package: [Gmail Notifier 2.4](https://github.com/xavierfoucrier/gmail-notifier/releases/download/v2.4-release/Gmail.Notifier.2.4.exe)

#### Portable version
The portable version is made for users who want to install the application on a **USB key**, or **removable drive**. In the uninstall process, you will need to manually remove some files from the *%AppData%* folder or edit the registry to completely remove the application from your computer. Portable versions are **no longer available since official 1.0 release**. Recommended for beta-tester users.

#### Old versions

You can grab an old version of the application in the [Github version history](https://github.com/xavierfoucrier/gmail-notifier/tags): keep in mind that the alpha/beta versions are just "pre-releases" and **are not** "production environment" ready. Recommended for power users.
